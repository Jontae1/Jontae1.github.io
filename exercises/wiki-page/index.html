                    Hunter × Hunter (pronounced "hunter hunter") is a Japanese manga 
                    series written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. It has been 
                    serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump 
                    since March 1998, although the manga has frequently gone on extended 
                    hiatuses since 2006. Its chapters have been collected in 38 tankōbon 
                    volumes as of September 2024. The story focuses on a young boy named 
                    Gon Freecss who discovers that his father, who left him at a young age, 
                    is actually a world-renowned Hunter, a licensed professional who specializes 
                    in fantastical pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal species, 
                    treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting down lawless 
                    individuals. Gon departs on a journey to become a Hunter and eventually find
                     his father. Along the way, Gon meets various other Hunters and encounters the 
                     paranormal.

                    <h4>Setting <br></h4>
                    Hunters (ハンター, Hantā) are licensed, elite members of humanity who are capable of tracking 
                    down secret treasures, rare beasts, or even other individuals, and can also access locations 
                    that regulars cannot.To obtain a license one must pass the rigorous annual Hunter Examination 
                    run by the Hunter Association, which has a success rate of less than one in a hundred-thousand
                    . A Hunter may be awarded up to three stars: a single star for making "remarkable achievements 
                    in a particular field"; they may then be upgraded to two stars for "holding an official position" 
                    and mentoring another Hunter up to single star level; and finally upgraded to three stars for "remarkable 
                    achievements in multiple fields".

                    Nen (念) is the ability to control one's own life energy or 
                    aura, which is constantly emitted from them, knowingly or not. There are four basic Nen techniques: 
                    Ten (纏) maintains the aura in the body, strengthening it for defense; 
                    Zetsu (絕) shuts the aura flow off, useful for concealing one's presence 
                    and relieving fatigue; Ren (練) enables a user to produce more Nen; and Hatsu 
                    (發) is a person's specific use of Nen.[8] Nen users are classified into six 
                    types based on their Hatsu abilities; Enhancers (強化系, Kyōkakei) strengthen and reinforce their 
                    natural physical abilities; Emitters (放出系, Hōshutsukei) project aura out of their bodies; Manipulators (操作系, 
                    Sōsakei) control objects or living things; Transmuters (変化系, Henkakei) change the type or properties of 
                    their aura; Conjurers (具現化系, Gugenkakei) create objects out of their aura; and Specialists (特質系, Tokushitsukei) 
                    have unique abilities that do not fall into the previous categories.[9] A Nen user can enter into a 
                    Contract (誓約, Seiyaku) where, by pledging to follow certain Limitations (制約, Seiyaku), their abilities are 
                    strengthened in relation to how strict they are. An example of this is Kurapika who, in order to have an 
                    unbreakable chain that will fully restrain members of the Phantom Troupe, offered his life, should he use 
                    it on anyone other than its members.

                    The story follows a young boy named Gon Freecss, who was told all his life that both his parents were dead. 
                    But when he learns from Kite, an apprentice of his father Ging Freecss, that he is still alive and has since 
                    become an accomplished Hunter, Gon leaves his home on Whale Island (くじら島, Kujira Tō) to take the Hunter 
                    Examination (ハンター試験, Hantā Shiken) in order to become a Hunter like him. During the exam, Gon meets and 
                    befriends three of the other applicants: Kurapika, the last remaining member of the Kurta clan who wishes to 
                    become a Hunter in order to avenge his clan and recover their scarlet-glowing eyes that were plucked from their 
                    corpses by a band of thieves known as the Phantom Troupe; Leorio, a prospective physician who, in order to pay 
                    for medical school, desires the financial benefits that Hunters receive; and Killua Zoldyck, another twelve-year-old 
                    boy who has left his former life as a member of the world's most notorious assassin family. Among many other 
                    examinees, Gon continuously encounters Hisoka, a mysterious and deadly transmuter who takes an interest in him. After 
                    many trials together, Gon and his friends end up passing the exam except for Killua, who fails after killing another 
                    applicant due to the influence of his brother, Illumi, and runs away to his family's estate in shame.
                    After Gon and the others convince Killua to rejoin their side, Leorio and Kurapika depart temporarily 
                    for their own personal reasons, while Gon and Killua set for the Heavens Arena (天空闘技場, Tenkū Tōgijō), 
                    a skyscraper where thousands of martial artists compete daily in fighting tournaments, seeking to improve themselves 
                    and gain monetary rewards.[14] There they meet Zushi, a fellow Heavens Arena applicant, who has a kung fu master named 
                    Wing who trains them in utilizing Nen, a Qi-like life energy used by its practitioners to manifest 
                    parapsychological abilities, and is also considered to be the final requirement to pass the Hunter Exam. Sometime later, 
                    Gon and his friends reunite again in Yorknew City (ヨークシンシティ, Yōkushin Shiti) where they have a 
                    clash with the Phantom Troupe.

                    During the occasion, two from the band of thieves are killed by Kurapika and he 
                    is forced to give up the chance of hunting down the rest in order to rescue Gon and Killua from being captured, 
                    but not without succeeding in sealing the powers of their leader, Chrollo Lucilfer.
                    A few days later, Gon and Killua achieve their objective and begin playing Greed Island, an extremely rare and 
                    expensive video game with Nen-like properties following some clues about Ging's whereabouts.[15] While exploring the 
                    game, it is revealed that its scenario is actually set somewhere in the real world, created with Nen by a team led by 
                    none other than Ging himself. Outclassed by the challenges in the game at first, they are soon joined and trained 
                    by Biscuit Krueger, an experienced teacher of Nen and kung fu master. With Biscuit's help, Gon and Killua train their 
                    Nen and learn to shape their abilities to their traits. Killua takes a short break from Greed Island to apply for the 
                    Hunter Examination again, this time passes with success. The trio then complete the game together against all 
                    odds and Gon obtains the right to choose the artifacts from the game necessary to reunite with his father.

                    The first Hunter × Hunter anime series has enjoyed much more modest popularity than its manga source. 
                    Newtype listed it as having a Japanese television rating of 10.5 for the fourth quarter of 2000. The 
                    show's viewership was ranked number six among the top ten anime television series in Japan for February 
                    2001. The series was voted as the 16th best anime of 2000 in the Anime Grand Prix, but rose to fourth 
                    place the following year. In 2001, the staff of the magazine listed Hunter × Hunter as the 94th most 
                    important anime of all time. In a 2006 web poll conducted in Japan by the network TV Asahi, the Hunter × 
                    Hunter television series was voted 28th best anime of all time. In 2010, Mania.com's Briana Lawrence 
                    listed Hunter × Hunter at number nine of the website's "10 Anime Series That Need a Reboot".
                    Critical reception for the first Hunter × Hunter television adaptation has been generally favorable. Miyako 
                    Matsuda of Protoculture Addicts, Carl Kimlinger of the Anime News Network, and Derrick L. Tucker of THEM 
                    Anime Reviews all expressed positive views of the series' narrative and characters. Matsuda admired the 
                    adventure-filled world of Hunter × Hunter and the practical character qualities of friendship, effort, and 
                    victory inserted by Togashi.Beginning with the second Viz DVD volume, Kimlinger summarized, "Togashi's 
                    plotting is canny and occasionally insightful and Furuhashi's visuals inventive yet attuned to the 
                    measured pacing of the series. Together they create a shonen action series that is both fun to watch and 
                    curiously respectful of its audience's intelligence. A strange combination indeed." Tucker admitted to 
                    being "bewitched" by the series mainly due to the remarkable and original characters, especially the interplay 
                    between the vastly different personalities of the Phantom Troupe members. Kimlinger gave particular praise to 
                    the characteristics of the complex villain Hisoka and the deep, emotional transformation of Kurapika in the 
                    latter half of the series. Theron Martin of Anime News Network, found the first fifteen episodes entertainment, 
                    and stated "Gon also inherits Goku's inherent likability, some of the "part of the challenge is figuring out 
                    what the challenge is" bits are rather clever, and setting up a situation where a tournament proctor is actually 
                    called out for being in the wrong is a nice twist.</p> 
                    
                    <p>It does also have some fun moments".
                    The art and animation of the Hunter × Hunter anime have also been commended by the press. Kimlinger and Tucker were 
                    impressed by the art direction of Hunter × Hunter, the former of whom critiquing the adaptation of Togashi's work by 
                    Furuhashi as having "understated energy and flair, making the most of the era's (1999) mix 
                    of traditional and CG animation to bring Gon and friends' physical feats to fluid, exhilarating life." 
                    Martin faulted both the artwork and the subtle differences in character design. "The artistry not only shows its 
                    age but, in fact, looks older than it actually is," the reviewer commented, "hearkening back to a day when digital coloring 
                    and CG enhancements were not ubiquitous and allowances for a rougher look were greater." Opinions of the series' 
                    sound and music have been somewhat mixed. Martin positively noted the soundtrack as the strongest production 
                    point of Hunter × Hunter, and was satisfied with both the English translation of the script and Ocean's 
                    voice overs. Tucker found the music satisfactory and improved as the series progressed, but did not think 
                    it lived up to its potential. Kimlinger agreeably felt the musical score to be appropriate in most instances, but 
                    criticized the English dub as "a letdown since day one".
