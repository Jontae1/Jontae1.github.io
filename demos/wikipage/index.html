            <b>Crown shyness</b> 
            (also <i>canopy disengagement,<sup>[1]</sup>canopy shyness,[2] or inter-crown spacing[3])</i>
             is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.[4][5] The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs between trees of different species.[6][7] There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.[8]
